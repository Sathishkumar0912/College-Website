                    <p>Education at LPU is a holistic one, aimed at developing the intellectual and personal strengths of students. The LPU experience takes place both within and outside the classroom, nurturing creativity and innovation through challenging project work and participative learning. As each individual is unique and approaches life in a different manner, so we allow them to choose their own placement pathways based on their interest. LPU has collaborated with top companies for providing its students with industry immersion. At LPU, we also provide opportunity to globally expose students through our study abroad programmes.</p>
